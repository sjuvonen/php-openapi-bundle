PHP-OPENAPI-BUNDLE
===========

Symfony module for integration the [OpenAPI library](/sjuvonen/php-openapi) into a Symfony app.

As of now the documentation is very scarce. This is still work-in-progress and won't be fully documented until a stable release is on the cards.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- Symfony 6.0+
